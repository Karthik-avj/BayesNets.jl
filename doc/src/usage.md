# Usage

## Inference

Inference methods for discrete Bayesian networks can be used via the `infer` method:

```julia
bn = DiscreteBayesNet()
push!(bn, DiscreteCPD(:a, [0.3,0.7]))
push!(bn, DiscreteCPD(:b, [0.2,0.8]))
push!(bn, DiscreteCPD(:c, [:a, :b], [2,2], 
        [Categorical([0.1,0.9]),
         Categorical([0.2,0.8]),
         Categorical([1.0,0.0]),
         Categorical([0.4,0.6]),
        ]))

Ï• = infer(bn, :c, evidence=Assignment(:b=>1))
```

Several inference methods are available. Exact inference is the default.

| `Inference Method` | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `ExactInference`   | Performs exact inference using discrete factors and variable elimination|
| `LikelihoodWeightingInference` | Approximates p(query \ evidence) with N weighted samples using likelihood weighted sampling |
| `LoopyBelief` | The loopy belief propagation algorithm |
| `GibbsSamplingNodewise` | Gibbs sampling where each iteration changes one node |
| `GibbsSamplingFull` | Gibbs sampling where each iteration changes all nodes |
